# Math-Practice-App
A Java JFrame app that helps kids with math. This app uses classes as well as a lot of JFrame elements to create a fun math game. 
You can choose to practice addition subtraction, division or multiplication. 
You can also choose how many questions you wish to be asked and if you want to also have a timer running to add a little spice to the test. 

This is part of my Java Journey.
